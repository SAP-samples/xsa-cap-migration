XSA TO CAP Migration: Automated Script
=====================================
## Introduction:
The Automated script is used to migrate applications from HANA CDS to CAP CDS. It is written in the NodeJS framework. The script will create a new CAP application and copy the database of the XSA application and modify it to support the CAP format based on the option selected.

## Features Currently supported in Migration Script:
- Creating an initial CAP application involves enhancing project configuration for SAP HANA Cloud and XSUAA, generating an MTA deployment descriptor, odata v2 support , sqlite support and Build Configuration.
  
- Converting "hdbconstraint", "hdbindex", "hdbview", "hdbtable", "hdbsequence", "hdbprocedure", "hdbtablefunction", "hdbfunction", "hdbstructuredprivilege", "hdblibrary", "hdbcalculationview", "hdbanalyticprivilege",
"hdbrole", "hdbsynonymconfig", "hdbtabledata", artefacts into a CAP (Cloud Application Programming) compliant format.

- Converting the file extensions from "hdbcds" files into "cds" for CAP compliance.
  
- As part of the transition to CAP compliant format, the notation in view definitions should be modified from "" to ![]. This specific delimiter enhances the reliability of processing in CAP CDS.
  
- Coverts HANA CDS Datatypes to CAP CDS Datatypes.
       | HANA CDS | CAP CDS |
    |----------|---------|
    |LocalDate|Date|
    |LocalTime|Time|
    |UTCDateTime|DateTime|
    |UTCTimestamp|Timestamp|
    |BinaryFloat|Double|
  
- Replacing @OData.publish:true with @cds.autoexpose for enhanced functionality.
  
- Creates “.hdbtabletype” files corresponding to each table type definition.
  
- Converts temporary entities to regular entities in CAP CDS.
  
- Relocating all the CDS files from their individual directories, for instance, src/, to the corresponding db/cds folder in the CAP project. Additionally, an index.cds file referring to these CDS files is created in the src folder.
  
- Log file generation using CDS Compile.
  
- Converts the technical configuration and element configuration to be CAP compliant, accomplished through the use of “@sql.append”. 
- Remove Series Entity which is not supported in CAP CDS
  
- Replaceing the annotation  @Comment  for table and element with “/** */ “to CAP Compliant Format and adding parameters required in package.json.
  
- Remove Schema Configuration.
  
- Updates .hdinamespace file with the proper configuration.
  
- Rename the other Hana database artifacts to SAP CAP CDS supported format. Specifically, entities should be converted to uppercase and any instances of “.”, “::” should be replaced with “_”.
  
- Copy the UI/ web folder into CAP Application.
  
- Removes empty directories.
  
- Removes full text index which is no longer supported in hana-cloud.
  
- Creates skeleton file for calculation views.
  
- Formatting the cds files is done with @sap/cds-lsp.
  
- Renaming the annotations.

## Features not covered in Migration Script and Limitations:

- Creating proxy cds for “.hdbtable”, “.hdbview”, “.hdbcalculationview”
  
- Converting xsodata into cap service definition
  
- Converting “xsjs”,”xsjslib” into cap nodejs
  
- Creating proxy cds for cross container schemas
  
- Unsupported datatypes in calculation views ex: since the date() function is not supported in SAP HANA Cloud need to converted into daydate().
  
- SQL syntax changes in procedure is not integrated ex: UPDATE FROM has to be changed into MERGE INTO, TRUNCATE statement with a DELETE FROM statement
  
- Flowgraph and Replication Artefacts Changes  are not supported

## Requirements:

1. We can use SAP BAS or VScode for script execution.
2. The code for the source application should be cloned into a local system directory.

## Usage:

1. Clone the git repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/xsa-cap-migration.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the script folder.
   ```
   cd migration-script
   ```
3. Install the required node modules by running the command `npm install`.
4. Execute the script by running the command `npm run start`.
5. Once the script is running, provide the below parameters to execute the script

## Note:
- This script is used to migrate the SHINE demo application to CAP. For other projects, we have to adjust the calcview.xsl with the attributes used in the project before running the script.
- The rename can be called for different Hana Artifacts. List the file extensions in the [config.json.tpl](config.json.tpl) file.
- For Multiple containers, mta.yaml has to be updated with service replacements. Example: [mta.yaml](https://github.com/SAP-samples/xsa-cap-migration/blob/main/hana-shine-cap/mta.yaml#L48-L56)
